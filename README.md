# major_prediction

I designed this project as part of one my internship interviews where I had to predict majors for students based on their course grades. 

I was given a training dataset of 10,000 students with their grades and majors. My task was to predict majors for 2,000 new students based on the training set. 

I was able to achieve over 95% accuracy for my test set.
